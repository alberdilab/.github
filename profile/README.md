# AlberdiLab repository
This is the master repository of the AlberdiLab research group at the Universit of Copenhagen, which hosts and links repos produced in out team with relevant code, data and software.

## Software

### DistillR
distillR is an R package for distilling functional annotations of bacterial genomes and metagenomes into meaningful quantitative metrics defined as Genome-Inferred Functional Traits (GIFT).

### hilldiv2
hilldiv2 is an R package that provides a set of functions to assist analysis of diversity for diet reconstruction, microbial community profiling or more general ecosystem characterisation analyses based on Hill numbers, using OTU/ASV/MAG tables, and associated phylogenetic trees and trait/attribute tables as inputs.
